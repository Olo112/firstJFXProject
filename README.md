# first JFX Projects
My JavaFX beginning projects or my journey through programming in Java and learning
the JavaFX library for GUI

## Main.java
Main program must always be in every folder because programmer must know where should the
program start running. Usually, the controller.java program looks like this:
```java
package sample;

public class Controller {
}

```

<br>

## Controller.java
Is a class of which object is created by FXML file and used to init UI styles such as text
style, or some object color. It is very similar to the HTML language:

```html
<head>
   <title>My website</title> 
</head>
```


Except that here, we have an **FXML** code file with all the UI as said earlier.
